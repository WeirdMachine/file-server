# Static file server

This project is a coding challenge which aims to server static files in java via HTTP without framework support.

## Notes

This is just a proof of concept and does not implement the full HTTP Standard. For example the socket connection get 
always closed no matter what. For that reason this project uses a more functional approach over object orientation.

I decided not to use a template engine for my single html page and relied on java strings to do so. 
Sadly text blocks are still in preview and disabled by default.
